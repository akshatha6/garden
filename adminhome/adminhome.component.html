Shallow dishes can be a great spot for birds to bathe and honeybees to drink (set a few rough-textured stones of varying sizes inside so honeybees can drink without falling in), while butterfly puddling areas, basically a shallow tray with some sand and stones set inside, can be a great place for them to pick up minerals and nutrients while drinking.</p>

The internal wick system absorbs water from the reservoir like a sponge, drawing water up to the plant roots. Plants will only absorb the amount of water they require. No more over- or under-watering; your plants will thrive!</p>

                <h4>Bulb Plants That Will Keep Coming Back</h4>
                            
                            <p class="text-muted">Flowering bulb plants count among nature's best magic, since the bulb is more than just a seed. It holds everything the plant needs to get a start in life. The plant's foliage recharges the bulb after blooming, so that it can bloom again the following year.
      
                              Naturalized bulbs go even farther. Bulbs that are good for naturalizing offer their flowers spring after spring for decades. But they also form new bulbs and expand their range.
                              
                              The number of flowers increases year after year without any action on your part. You don't need to seed or divide. Naturalized bulbs create new bulbs themselves, slowly but surely spreading through the area and creating a beautiful, meadow-style planting.
